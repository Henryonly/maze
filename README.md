# maze
Look,there's a maze!
What you need to do is to escape the maze as fast as you can.While you attempt to leave,we have a clock to record your time.Then your time would be collected by the game hub.Grades of this game will be saved and seen to all.We'll sort the game and display the best five people.
This game is still in exploitation.I mean to add monsters in this game.If you touch them,you'll be eaten and lose the game.It means that if you're forced into a dead end,the game will end up losing.So be careful.Don't rush and take care of your surroundings.
This project is my first one with computer networks.I hope you'll like it and wish you a good time.
